                National average salary: $94,110 per year (Bureau of Labor Statistics)
                
                Primary duties: Careers in climatology involve a focus on long-term weather patterns in specific areas. Climatologists are problem-solvers who examine the factors that influence the weather over the course of many decades, which is often based on a 30-year cycle. They can be found collecting soil samples, analyzing data and presenting their research to the community. Climatologists may work as weather forecasters or developers of new measurement tools.
                
                7. Aeronautical engineer
                National average salary: $99,796 per year
                
                Primary duties: Behind every spaceship and satellite is an aeronautical engineer who designed its structure and operating functions. Beyond the spacecraft, these engineers also design the space mission itself. Aeronautical engineers possess expert-level knowledge of several key components of space exploration. They must understand how a rocket's design and propulsion will interact with the Earth's gravitational pull and orbit, as well as the environment in space.
